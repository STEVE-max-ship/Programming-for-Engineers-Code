<p align="justify">

A map is a rectangular array of integers.
A river cascade  is a sequence of cells in in the map.
The cascade cells are all located in either one row or in one column.
There is a first cell in a cascade. If the cascade is located in a row
then all cell are located to the right of the first cell.
If the cascade is located in a column then all cells in the cascade
are located below the first cell.
Each next cell in the cascade is adjacent to the previous cell.
The value in each cell, except for the first cell,
is bigger by exacly one than the value in the previous cell.
<br>
A predecessor cell of a cascade is  a cell which is adjacent to the first cell of the cascade,
and which lies in the same row or column as the whole cascade and which is not a part
of the cascade.
A successor cell of a cascade is  a cell which is adjacent to the last cell of the cascade,
and which lies in the same row or column as the whole cascade and which is not a part
of the cascade.
The value of the predecesor cell, if it exists, is not equal to the
value of the first cell minus 1.
The value of the successor cell, if it exists, is not equal to the
value of the last cell plus 1.
the length of a cascade is the number of cells in it.


<!-- T H E   T A S K  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- -->


<h3><font color="blue">The task</font></h3>
Count the number of cascades of a given length in the whole input map.

<!-- I N P U T  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- -->

<h3><font color="blue">Input</font></h3>
<p align="justify">
The first input line contains three integers R, C, L separated by space.
They represent, in this order, the number of rows in the map, the number
of columns in the map and the length of a cascade.
Next, there are R lines of input, each contains C values separated by spaces.
Each line contains values of the corresponding map row.
<br>
The size of the map does not exceed 100 &times; 100 cells.

</p>

<h3><font color="blue">Output</font></h3>
<p align="justify">
There are two output lines, the first line contains the number
of cascades in the map oriented horizontally and the second line
contains the number of cascades in the map oriented vertically.
