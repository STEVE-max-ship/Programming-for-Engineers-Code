# practices 02

# Common input format
# -------------------
# (Read the tasks descriptions below before reading this paragraph.)
# All tasks in practices 02 set share common data input format:
# The first line contains the number of the task (1 - 5).
# The second line contains the dimensions R and C of the input rectangular matrix.
# The first is the vertical size R (number of rows),
# the second is the horizontal size C (number of columns),
# they are separated by space.
# Next, there are R lines of input, each contains C values separated by spaces.
# Each line contains values of the corresponding matrix row.
# The input always contain exactly one data set of one task.
# In the evaluation system, the code is run repeatedly, each time with different input.

# Solution code structure
# -----------------------
# The code reads the input data, including the number of the task.
# Next, it runs a function or a block of code which accepts the input data
# and computes and prints the solution to it.
# It is recommended to wrap the solution of each task in a separate function,
# an example (not obligatory!) structure of the code
# is illustrated by the contents of this file.


# ================================================================================
# Task 01
# For the given matrix,  print in ascending order,
# the indexes of columns with exactly two distinct values in it.
# If there is no such column, print word None.
# The output values are separated by single spaces on a single line.

# ================================================================================
# Task 02

# In the given matrix, find maximum of sums of all submatrices of size  2x2
# and count the number of occurrences of this maximum in the whole matrix.
# The sum of a submatrix is the sum of all its elements.
# # The size of input matrix is in range[3x3 .. 1000x1000].
# Output consists of one line with two integers separated by space:
# The maximum sum of a 2x2 submatrix of the input matrix
# and the number of occurrences of a submatrices with this sum in the input matrix.

The maximum 2x2 sum, equal to 4, is attained at submatrices with their
upper left corners at positions [0][2], [0][3], and [1][0].

# Task 03

# For a given rectangular matrix M, create a new matrix P,
# which dimensions are the same as the dimensions of M.
# For each non-zero value in M at position [i][j] it holds,
# that P contains the same value at position [i][j].
# For each zero value in M at position [i][j] it holds,
# that P contains at position [i][j] the sum of all values
# which are either above this zero in the same column in M
# or to the right of this zero in the same row in M.
# The size of input matrix M is in range[3x3 .. 300x300].
# If both matrix sizes are not bigger than 20, print matrix P
# in the same format as the input matrix M, do not print the
# dimensions of P.
# If the size of M is bigger than 20 x 20, print only the
# rightmost bottommost submatrix of P of size 20x20.
# In any case, print also, after the (sub)matrix, on the next line,
# the total of all values by which were the zeros substituted.

# Task 04

# Modify the input NxN matrix of integers in the following way.
# All matrix items which are located outside the main diagonal
