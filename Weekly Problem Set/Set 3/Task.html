# Practices 03

# Common input format
# -------------------
# (Read the tasks descriptions below before reading this paragraph.)
# All tasks in practices 03 set share common data input format:
# The first line contains the number of the task (1 - 5).
# The second line contains the number N of strings in the input.
# Next, there are N lines of input, each contains one input string.
# Each string consists only of alphanumerical symbols, and it does not contain any blank space(s).
# The input of the whole program always contain exactly one data set of one task.
# In the evaluation system, the code is run repeatedly, each time with different input.

# Solution code structure
# -----------------------
# The code reads the input data, including the number of the task.
# Next, it runs a function or a block of code which accepts the input data
# and computes and prints the solution to it.
# It is recommended to wrap the solution of each task in a separate function,
# an example (not obligatory!) structure of the code
# is illustrated by the contents of this file.


# ====================================================================================================================
# Task 01
#
# We are given a list of strings. We have to divide each  string
# in half and create two new strings, A and B. String A will contain all
# first halves of the strings in the list and string B will contain
# all second halves of the strings in the list.
# The order of the halves in the resulting string will correspond to the
# order of their respective strings in the input list.
# When the length of a string is odd, its first half ends
# immediately after the middle character of the string, and also there the second half begins.
# The total of lengths of all strings in the list is less than 10^5.
# Print A and B on separate lines

# ====================================================================================================================
# Task 02

# In the given string, find the number of substrings
# which contain exactly one symbol 0 and exactly one symbol 1.
# In this problem, we count each occurrence of a substring separately.
# That is, when two identical substrings occur at different
# positions in the original string, each of these substrings is counted separately.
# The input list of strings contains at most 5 strings, the length of each is at most 5000 characters.
# Print the result for each string on a separate line.

  Comment
The substrings in the first string are are  n0v1 ,0v1, v10, v10s, v10se, 10, 10s, 10se, 0se1, g1c0, 1c0, c01, 01.

# Task 03

# A substring S1 of string S is a constant substring when
# all four following conditions are met:
#   (1)   len(S1) > 1,
#   (2)   all characters in S1 are the same,
#   (3)   the character immediately before S1 is
#               either non-existing (S1 is at the beginning of S)
#               or it differs from characters in S1,
#   (4)   the character immediately after S1 is
#               either non-existing (S1 is at the end of S)
#               or it differs from characters in S1,
# The task is to identify all constant substrings in a given string
# and then to remove them all from the given string.
# Note that two constant substrings cannot overlap one another in the string.
# After removal of all constant substrings from a given string,
# the reduced string may contain new constant substrings.
# Example:
#     S = abcxxcbdyyyzzzzfgzzgf
#     The constant substrings are: xx, yyy, zzzz, zz.
#     After removal of constant substrings:
#     S = abccbdfggf
#     Now S contains other constant substrings: cc, gg
#
# In your solution, proceed in repeated steps. In each step, remove from S all constant substrings
# which are in S at the beginning of the step.
# Stop when S contains no constant substring and print S.
# The length of the given input string S is at most 5000, there are at most 5 strings in the input.

# Task 04

# In the given input string, find the longest substring which contains exactly one word 'May'.
# If more substrings share the same maximum length print them all,
# in the order in which they appear in the original string, from left to right.
# Each output string occupies exactly one text line.
# if the word May is not present in the entire string, output string None on one line.
# Print a row of four asterisks, and no other symbols,
# after the entire output for each input string.
# (It helps to separate visually the outputs corresponding to different input strings.)
# The length of the given input string  is at most 5000, there are at most 5 strings in the input.
