<h2><font color="blue">Z-bent Paths in an Array</font></h2>





<p align="justify">

Let us consider a rectangular array with <i>R</i> rows and <i>C</i> columns, containing numerical values. <br>

A <b>path</b> is a sequence of cells in the array,
in which each next cell (with the exception of the first cell)
is adjacent to the previous cell in the path. <br>
In this problem, we consider adjacency in only four principal directions: left, righ, up, down.
Two cells which share only one corner (they are positioned diagonally with respect to each other) are not adjacent.
<br>
<br>


A <b>z-bent path</b> is a path with a distinct shape, position, contents of the path itself and its immediate surroundings. It is described below.
(While reading the description, step by step, you may compare it with example Image 1.)   <br>
A z-bent path consists of three straight parts. The width of each part is exacly one cell. <br>
The first part and the third part are horizontal, the middle part (the second part) is vertical.<br>
The last cell in the first part is equal to the first cell in the second part
and the last cell in the second part is equal to the first cell in the third part.
<br>
The first part starts at the left border of the array.
The third part ends at the right border of the array.
<br>
No cell in any part touches the top border or the bottom border of the array.
No cell in the central (second) part touches any border of the array.
<br>
The number of cells in the central part of the z-bent path is 4.
<br>
The first part is closer to the top border of the array then the third part. 
<br>
All cells which are part of a z-bent path contain zeroes.
<br>
Each cell which is not on the z-bent path and which is adjacent to
some cell in the z-bent path contains a positive value.
<br>
Any path or any sequence of cells which does not satisfy all conditions given above is not a z-bent path.
<br><br>



The <b>coordinates</b> of a z-bent path consist of two numbers. The first number is the
index of the row in which the z-bent path starts, and the second number is the
index of the column in which the central part is located.

<b>Image 1.</b>  Example of an array with two z-bent paths. Their coordinates are
1 2 and 7 7. The cells of the z-bent paths are depicted with white background.
The cells which are adjacent to the cells of z-bent paths are depicted with
dark background and white font. Note that all those cells contain non-zero values.
The Image illustrates Example 1 below.

<h3><font color="blue">The task</font></h3>

Print the coordinates of all z-bent paths in the given array.

 <hr>


<!-- I N P U T  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- -->

<h3><font color="blue">Input</font></h3>
<p align="justify">
The first input line contains two positive integers <i>R</i>, <i>C</i> separated by space.
They represent, in this order, the number of rows in the array and the number
of columns in the array.  <br>
Next, there are <i>R</i> lines of input, each contains <i>C</i> values separated by spaces.
Each line contains values of the corresponding array row.

The size of the array is at most 1000 &times; 1000.
The values in the array are non-negative integers less then 10.
</p>

<h3><font color="blue">Output</font></h3>
<p align="justify">
The output contains the coordinates of all z-bent paths in the given array, in the ascending order of the rows.
Each output line contains the coordinates of one z-bent path, separated by space.
<br>
It is guaranteed that there is always at least one z-bent path in the input array.
